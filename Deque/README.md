# Deque Project

This project implements a Double-Ended Queue (DEQE) data structure in Java, supporting insertion and removal at both ends. This project was developed as part of SER 222 coursework at Arizona State University.

## Requirements

Java 11 or higher (tested and works with Java 25)

Tested with Windows 11

## Compilation

If your source files are located in src/edu/ser222/m01_03/ (or the appropriate directory for this project) and youâ€™re compiling to an output directory named out, use the following command:

javac -d out src/edu/ser222/m01_03/*.java

## Running

Navigate to the project root, then run the main class from the out folder using its package name. For example:

Windows:

java -cp out edu.ser222.m04_01.CompletedDeque
