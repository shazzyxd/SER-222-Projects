## Requirements

Java 11 or higher (tested and works with Java 25)

Tested with Windows 11

## Compilation

If your source files are located in src/edu/ser222/m02_01/ (or the appropriate directory for this project) and youâ€™re compiling to an output directory named out, use the following command:

javac -d out src/edu/ser222/m02_01/*.java

## Running

Navigate to the project root, then run the main class from the out folder using its package name. For example:

Windows:

java -cp out edu.ser222.m02_01.CompletedBenchmarkTool
