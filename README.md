# SER222 Coursework ‚Äì Arizona State University

This repository contains a collection of Java projects developed as part of the SER222: Data Structures and Algorithms course at Arizona State University.
Each directory represents a separate module or assignment demonstrating core algorithmic concepts and data structure implementations.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository includes eight project directories, each focused on a different topic in data structures and algorithms:

| Directory |	Description|
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Binary_Search_Tree 	| Binary Search Tree implementation |
| Deque	    | Data structure supporting efficient insertion and removal of elements from both ends                                     |
| Directed Graph	| Graph data structures and traversal algorithms                         |
| Hash_Tables	| Linear, Two, Quad Probe Chain Hash Tables                        |
| List	| Ordered List implementation                  |
| Matrix	| Implementation and manipulation of 2D matrices                     |
| MergeSort	| Sorting algorithms                     |
| Shell_Insertion_Sort	| Benchmarking of Shell and Insertion Sort                 |
